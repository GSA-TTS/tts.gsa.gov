    items:
      - The USDC program places Fellows for 90% of their time on a high priority project at a placement agency. The remaining 10% of time is spent with the USDC Corps and is focused on coaching, learning and development, and participation in the USDC Community. Because of this structure, day to day management of Fellow’s work is done by the placement agency and each USDC Supervisor manages 15-20 Fellows within their technical area of expertise, with support structures that vary depending on the needs of the fellows. As such, the majority of time between Supervisor and Fellow is focused on Fellow coaching, growth, and support and not activities like tasking or reviewing project work.
      - This U.S. Digital Corps Supervisor is a skilled Data Science and Analytics technologist in their own right and uses their discipline specific knowledge, excellence in coaching & management, and ongoing engagements with USDC Fellows to inform the design and execute the delivery of the Data Science and Analytics Fellow learning & development curriculum throughout the two year cohort experience. This USDC Supervisor takes the lead on USDC Data Track specific programming within their domain of expertise.
      - A USDC Supervisor also works closely with Agency partners to ensure that Fellows receive the structures and support to be successful while on placement with their Agency, starting before the Fellow begins work, through the fellowship period, and until the final permanent offboarding transfer to the Agency occurs.
