TTS is proud to be an equal opportunity employer and to build a workforce that reflects the diversity of the citizens that we serve. We invite all eligible United States citizens and nationals (residents of American Samoa and Swains Islands) to apply to work at TTS. 

The federal hiring process differs from industry and private-sector hiring. Federal hiring often takes longer than industry and requires specific actions. Here is an expected timeline of the hiring process at TTS:

- Application collection - 5 business days or until an application cap is met
- Resume qualification - 2 to 3 weeks
- Interviews - 1 month
- Offer and security - 2 to 3 months
- Total from application to start - 3 to 5 months

## Info Sessions

TTS hosts monthly general hiring information sessions and role-specific sessions for upcoming or newly-opened roles. At our general sessions, candidates learn about working at TTS, what types of roles we hire for, and more about the application process. Our role-specific info sessions briefly cover some of the same information and offer a chance to hear directly from the hiring team about the vision for the role and what a day-in-the-life might actually look like. Candidates have an opportunity  to ask us questions about the application process, the work, and the team culture. TTS does not conduct one-on-one conversations with candidates about roles to ensure an equitable hiring process. Please attend one of our public information sessions for these details.

A list of upcoming information sessions can be found on the [JoinTTS homepage]({{ site.baseurl }}).

## Application

Applications are collected during the period specified in the [Basic Information section](https://join.tts.gsa.gov/federal-job-posting/#basic-information/) of the job posting, generally about a week or until an application cap is reached. After the period has closed, all applications are reviewed and evaluated  at the same time.

TTS does not use automated screening tools. Your application will be evaluated by a HR Specialist or a panel of subject matter experts. 

When you apply for a role at TTS, you are required to submit a [government-style resume](https://join.tts.gsa.gov/resume/). Be explicit in your resume and include all relevant work experiences and details. Do not assume the reader has expert knowledge or context of your job history. Because applications are reviewed by real people, the application review process typically takes several weeks, depending on the number of applications received.

## Interviews

The interview process typically takes about a month, with approximately 3-4 interview rounds. The first round is a 30-60 minute preliminary screen by phone or video. During this call, plan to talk briefly about your skills, experience, and professional passion. We’ll share more information about the role, the team, and the opportunity.

If you advance past the preliminary screen, we’ll invite you to a series of formal video interviews with various TTS team members. During these longer conversations, we will discuss your past work experience and how your skills and knowledge apply to TTS. Some positions may require a technical interview such as a coding exercise or leadership and collaboration interview before moving forward to the final round of interviews. 

The final round of interviews always include a TTS Core Values interview which is intended to evaluate candidate alignment with [the organization’s values](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/about-us/tts-history/#our-values).

We share copies of the interview guide, which includes the questions and interviewer names, in advance of your interviews. Sharing questions in advance provides you a more informed interview experience so you can better understand what we’re looking for. 

### Interview Format

We typically use Google Meet for our interviews. If you are not comfortable or familiar with using Google Meet, let your recruiter know and they will be happy to set up a test chat with you prior to your interviews! You can also test your sound and video prior to your interview using [these instructions](https://support.google.com/meet/answer/10409699?hl=en).

In case there are technical issues with your video call, you will also be provided with a dial-in number so you can call-in by phone.
We are happy to work with your individual needs to ensure you have a good interviewing experience and can use your preferred method of communication.

### Accommodations

We want to interview you at your best, and we’re more than happy to provide reasonable accommodations to support that! Let us know if there are accommodations that we can provide that will help you show your best self.

Some examples:

- Giving you extra time to answer questions
- Sharing questions in written form as well as verbally
- Bringing an emotional support or service animal to your interview
- Using a medium other than video chat
- Having a captioner or an ASL interpreter

## Security and Onboarding

If TTS identifies you as a strong candidate after we complete the interviews, a TTS recruiter will reach out to you with next steps. The hiring process continues in partnership with GSA’s (our parent agency) Human Resources team. They’re responsible for extending tentative and official final offers. The process is as follows:

- A GSA HR specialist will call you with a tentative offer. “Tentative” means the offer is contingent on a security clearance. This offer will include salary for your consideration.
  - **Please note:** This is only a tentative offer. At this point you should not give notice or resign from your current employer. You should delay these steps until you receive the final offer with a confirmed start date from HR.
- Once you have accepted the tentative offer, you will receive an email from the HR onboarding system. You will need to login and accept your tentative offer.
- Once you accept your tentative offer, you will complete a series of forms and receive a USAccess email requesting you to schedule a time to provide your fingerprints for your security clearance and complete an electronic questionnaire for investigation processing (e-QIP).
- Once your e-QIP has been initially cleared, you will receive an interim security clearance, and a GSA HR specialist will call you with a final offer.
- At this stage, GSA HR and the TTS Talent team will work with you to identify and set a start date.

### Security Clearance Documents

All government positions require some level of background check. Most roles at TTS require a public trust position clearance, which is more thorough than most private-sector background checks but not as intensive as a higher government security clearance. The clearance process adds some time and forms to the hiring process, but the GSA Human Resources team will guide you through it.

## More about how we hire

### TTS is an Equal Opportunity Employer

We’re building a team that reflects our country. We don’t discriminate based on race, color, culture, religion, sex, gender identity or expression, national origin, political affiliation, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, neurodiversity, genetic information, age, socio-economics, membership in an employee organization, retaliation, parental status, military service, or other non-merit factors.

### Hiring Authorities

There are three primary types of [hiring authorities](https://www.usajobs.gov/Help/working-in-government/service/) used by TTS: Direct Hire Authority, Competitive Service, and Excepted Service. The application and hiring process will vary slightly based on the type of role for which you are applying.

**Direct Hire Authority:** DHA is a special appointing authority and we use this authority to fill the majority of roles at TTS. Applications for these roles are completed on [USAJOBS.gov](https://usajobs.gov). DHA positions can be either term-limited or full-time career positions. See [About the Direct Hire Authority]({{ site.baseurl }}/about-the-dha/) for more details.

**Competitive Service:** Applicants for all competitive service roles must complete the application process at USAJOBS.gov. Individuals go through a competitive hiring process before being selected and appointed. This hiring process may consist of a written test, an evaluation of the individual’s education and experience, or an evaluation of other attributes necessary for successful performance in the position to be filled. Competitive Service roles can be either term-limited or full-time career opportunities.

**Excepted Service:** These roles are “not to exceed” (NTE) positions, which means they are two-year terms and can be extended once for a total of four years of service. These roles are not always posted on USAJOBS.gov. Instead, candidates can apply via our online application.

### Eligibility

All United States citizens and nationals (residents of American Samoa and Swains Islands) are eligible to apply.
