  Hi, from TTS! Whether you’re a first-time visitor or you’ve been following us for the last 10+ years, we’re excited to tell you more about [what we do](https://tts.gsa.gov/services/) and how we do it. As an organization focused on government innovation, from building platforms and websites to providing products and people through modern methodologies and technologies, TTS is delivering effective and efficient government services.

  This space will provide you with insight into the impactful work of the collaboration with our agency partners and updates on happenings across the more than 30 products and programs housed within TTS. We hope the information is helpful for everyone from federal digital managers and CIOs to industry partners and interested [technologists looking to be a part of public service](https://tts.gsa.gov/join/).

  We believe efficiency and effectiveness come from shared digital services built in partnership with industry to meet the needs and missions of our agency partners. Because TTS is housed within the [General Services Administration](https://www.gsa.gov/) Federal Acquisition Service, which provides shared services to all of the federal government, we have the unique opportunity to see technology challenges that affect many agencies at once. We bridge the gaps between agencies, building solutions across agency boundaries that meet shared needs, help agencies avoid reinventing the wheel, create economies of scale, and reduce costs and risk.

  If you’re curious about how technology is helping shape the future of government services and how government operates, we will be posting regularly with fresh stories written to keep you in [the loop](https://www.linkedin.com/company/gsa-tts/). We hope you will follow along as we move forward.
