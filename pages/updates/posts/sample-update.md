  The U.S. Digital Corps (USDC) is a new two-year fellowship for early-career technologists to launch impactful careers in public service and create a more effective, equitable government. USDC pairs early-career and highly-skilled, mission-driven software engineers, data scientists, product managers, designers, and cybersecurity specialists with top technology change-makers in the federal government to build human-centered solutions to some of our nationâ€™s toughest challenges. Our Fellows are the engines on projects that create change in the areas of climate, healthcare, racial equity, immigration, economic recovery, and open innovation. The Digital Corps was launched in August 2021 by GSA in partnership with the White House, CISA, and OPM.
