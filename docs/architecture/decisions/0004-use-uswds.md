# 4. Use the United States Web Design System

Date: 2022-08-04

## Status

Accepted

## Decision

We propose using the [United States Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) (USWDS) for tts.gsa.gov.

## Consequences

We predict that using USWDS will:

* Improve the accessibility of tts.gsa.gov, as measured by approved accessibility tools such as [pa11y](https://pa11y.org/) and [Accessibility Insights](https://accessibilityinsights.io/)
* Bring tsa.gsa.gov into full compliance with the 21st Century IDEA Act, which requires agencies to comply with website standards using the U.S. Web Design System

## Challenges

USWDS 3.0 was recently released and is still in the early adoption stages within projects at TTS. We would like to start from one of the USWDS templates but they all
seem to be using USWDS 2.x and updating the chosen Eleventy template may big a significant time investment at the start of the project.
